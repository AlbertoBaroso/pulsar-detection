# Pulsar detection

The goal of this project is to employ data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms written from scratch to identify pulsars from a collection of 17.898 pulsar candidates.

## Classification models

- Logistic Regression
- Multivariate Gaussian Classifier
- Tied Covariance Gaussian Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Tied Naive Bayes Classifier
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- Support vector machines (with RBF and Polynomial kernels)
